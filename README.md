## UX
This project aims to provide surfers or people interested in learning to surf with current and future surf forecasts for various surf spots in Ireland. Users will be able to navigate through a map with pre-loaded surf spots to check surf quality and nearby points of interest such as surf schools, cafÃ©s, accommodation and/or rentals.

### User Stories

> - _"I want to be able to find information regarding surf forecasts for that location"_
> - _"I want to know if there are surf schools, rentals, accommodation and/or places to eat nearby"_
> - _"I want to be able to get in touch to find out any information that isn't made readily available on the site"_
> - _"I want a site that is intuitive and requires minimal navigation to find the information I want"_

### Site Owner Stories

> - _"I want users to be able to easily navigate through the site"_
> - _"I want to give users the opportunity to discover new points of interest for their next surf trip"_
> - _"I want users to be able to contact me if they need further information"_

### Wireframes
A single page landing area was designed for ease of navigation for users across mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

## Features

### Existing Features
Navigation: The site is entirely navigable by a fixed navigation bar which contains links to each section of the site. 

Google Maps API: The Google Maps API has been optimized to give users a visual representation of where sites of interest, pinned as markers, included in the page can be found.

EmailJs: EmailJS was added to allow for users to contact the site owner directly and with ease.

### Features Left to Implement

Magic Seaweed API: Unfortunately the API key for the Magicseaweed was unavailable when making this project. If it were available it would have been implemented to give users the ability to see surf forecasts directly within the site.

Info Windows when clicked do not automatically close when another marker is clicked on. Due to inexperience and time constraints I was unable to fix this.

The collapsable navbar on clicking menu items does not close automatically. I did not have the time or ability to amend this.

Dropdowns for surf locations would have been implemented if time permitted.
