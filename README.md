## UX
This project aims to provide surfers or people interested in learning to surf with current and future surf forecasts for various surf spots in Ireland. Users will be able to navigate through a map with pre-loaded surf spots to check surf quality and nearby points of interest such as surf schools, cafÃ©s, accommodation and/or rentals.

### User Stories

> - _"I want to be able to find out what current and future forecasts look like for a specific location"_
> - _"I want information such as swell height, wind direction, wave height and tidal information to be available"_
> - _"I want to know if there are surf schools, rentals, accommodation and/or places to eat nearby"_
> - _"I want to be able to get in touch to find out any information that isn't made readily available on the site"_
> - _"I want a site that is intuitive and requires minimal navigation to find the information I want"_

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
### Wireframes

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used:
> [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
>
> [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
>
> [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)


### Libraries Used:
> [jQuery]
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
> - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used for version control and making changes to code files.
> - [Github](https://github.com/) - Used to host the Git repositories for this project on the cloud.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Testing

### Issues Encountered

## Version Control


## Code Validation

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
